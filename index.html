        <!-- About Me Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a prospective PhD student in Computer Science with a focus on <strong>AI for Science</strong>. My research centers on developing machine learning methods that can understand and leverage the fundamental geometric and topological structures inherent in scientific data, with particular emphasis on biological and molecular systems.</p>
            
            <p>I am interested in <strong>geometric representation learning</strong> for biological and molecular systems. My research aims to design learning algorithms whose representations respect intrinsic topology, symmetry, and causal structure, moving beyond traditional Euclidean assumptions.</p>
            
            <p>I have experience with machine learning problems across computational biology, physiological time-series, scientific imaging, and clinical applications. My work has involved topology-aware latent representations for circadian biology, causal disentanglement of environmental confounders, physics-aware learning for microscopy data, and robustness analysis of medical imaging models under distribution shift.</p>

        <!-- Research Interests Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My proposed work focuses on three integrated themes: <strong>enforcing geometric priors in latent variable models of cellular dynamics</strong>, <strong>creating unified representations for multimodal and spatial data</strong>, and <strong>developing compositional frameworks to deconstruct and predict the effects of perturbations</strong>.</p>
            <ul class="research-list">
                <li><strong>Geometric Deep Learning:</strong> Incorporating topological and geometric constraints into neural architectures to respect the intrinsic structure of biological and molecular systems</li>
                <li><strong>Causal Representation Learning:</strong> Disentangling causal mechanisms from observational data to build robust models that generalize across environmental conditions and perturbations</li>
                <li><strong>Multimodal Scientific Modeling:</strong> Developing unified frameworks that integrate diverse data modalities while preserving domain-specific physical and biological constraints</li>
