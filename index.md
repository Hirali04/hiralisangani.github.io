## Research Interests

My research focuses on **geometric representation learning for scientific data**, with an emphasis on biological and molecular systems. I am interested in designing learning algorithms whose representations respect intrinsic **topology, symmetry, and causal structure**, rather than relying on purely Euclidean assumptions. My current interests include structure-preserving molecular representations, geometry-aware generative models, and representation learning methods for scientific discovery.

## Research Experience

I have worked on machine learning problems across computational biology, physiological time-series, scientific imaging, and clinical applications. My research has involved topology-aware latent representations for circadian biology, causal disentanglement of environmental confounders, physics-aware learning for microscopy data, and robustness analysis of medical imaging models under distribution shift.
